###### Pag 18 - Passion is a side effect of mastery:
factors described as the "nutriments" required to feel intrinsically motivated for your work:

- Autonomy: the feeling that you have control over your day, and that vour actions are important
- Competence: the feeling that you are good at what you do
- Relatedness: the feeling of connection to other people

###### Pag 42 - The economics of great jobs:
In the last chapter I offered a bold proposition: If you want to love what you do, abandon the passion mindset (what can the world offer me?") and instead adopt the craftsman mindset ("what can I offer the world?”). My argument for this strategy starts with a simple question: What makes a great job great? In exploring this question, it helps to get specific. In Rule #1, I provided several examples of people who had great jobs and love (or loved) what they do-so we can draw from there.

1. TRATIS THAT DEFINE GREAT WORK
	- Creativity: Ira Glass, for example, is pushing the boundaries of radio, and winning armfuls of awards in the process.
	- Impact: From the Apple II to the iPhone, Steve Jobs has changed the way we live our lives in the digital age.
	- Control: No one tells Al Merrick when to wake up or what to wear.

2. THE CAREER CAPITAL THEORY OF GREAT WORK
	- The traits that define great work are rare and valuable.
	- Supply and demand says that if you want these traits you need rare and valuable skills to offer in return. Think of these rare and valuable skills you can offer as your career capital.
	- The craftsman mindset, with its relentless focus on becoming "so good they can't ignore you," is a strategy well suited for acquiring career capital. This is why it trumps the passion mindset if your goal is to create work you love.

You need to get good in order to get good things in your working life, and the craftsman mindset is focused on achieving exactly this goal.

###### Pag 56 - When craftsmanship fails:
John had heard this argument and wrote me because he was having a hard time applying it to his life as a tax consultant. He didn't like his work and he wanted to know if, like a good craftsman, he should just suck it up and continue to focus on getting good. This is an important question, and here's what I told John: "It sounds like you should leave your job." On reflec-

tion, it became clear to me that certain jobs are better suited for applying career capital theory than others. To aid John, I ended up devising a list of three traits that disqualify a job as providing a good foundation for building work you love:

THREE DISQUALIFIES FOR APPLYING THE CRAFTSMAN MINDSET

1. The job presents few opportunities to distinguish yourself by developing relevant skills that are rare and valuable.
2. The job focuses on something you think is Use less of perhaps even actively bad for the world.
3. The job forces you to work with people you really dislike

###### Pag 78 - Why is Jordan Tice a better guitar player than me?
"The harder I work, the more relaxed I can play, and the better it sounds.” These observations, of course, are about more than

just guitar playing. The central idea of this chapter is that the difference in strategy that separates average guitar players like me from stars like Tice and Casstevens is not confined to music.

###### Pag 84 - How to become a grand master:
To successfully adopt the craftsman mindset, therefore, we have to approach our jobs in the same way that Jordan approaches his guitar play. ing or Garry Kasparov his chess training--with a dedication to deliberate practice.

###### Pag 86 - Alex Berger craves criticism and Mike Jackson doesn't check email:
The other thing I noticed about Alex is that this learning is not done in isolation: "You need to be constantly soliciting feedback from colleagues and professionals, he told me. During his rise, Alex consistently chose projects where he'd be forced to show his work to others.

His new tool of choice is a spreadsheet, which he uses to track how he spends every hour of every day. "At the beginning of each week I figure out how much time I want to spend on different activities,” he explained. "I then track it so I can see how close I

came to my targets." On the sample spreadsheet he sent me, he divides his activities into two categories: hard to change (i.e., weekly commitments he can't avoid) and highly changeable (i.e., self-directed activities that he controls).

###### Pag 100 - Summary of rule 2
1. Rule 1: It argued that the passion hypothesis, which says that the key to loving your work is to match a job to a pre-existing passion, is bad advice.

2. Rule 2 was the first to tackle the natural follow-up question: If "follow your passion" is bad advice, what should you do instead?

I argued that it's important to adopt the craftsman mindset, where you focus relentlessly on what value you're offering the world.

###### Pag 117 - Control requires capital (The First Control Trap):
Control that's acquired without career capital is not sustainable.

put into our terminology, enthusiasm alone is not rare and valuable and is therefore not worth much in terms of career capital. This life-style designer was investing in a valuable trait but didn’t have the means to pay for it.

###### Pag 131 - Control generates resistance (The Second Control Trap):
The point at which you have acquired enough career capital to get meaningful control over your working life is exactly the point when you’ve become valuable enough to your current employer that they will try to prevent you from making the change.

In other words, in most jobs you should expect your employer to resist your move toward more control; they have every incentive to try to convince you to reinvest your career capital back into your career at their company, obtaining more money and prestige instead of more control, and this can be a hard argument to resist.
	
###### Pag 139 - The law of financial viability:
When deciding whether to follow an appealing pursuit that will introduce more control into your work life, seek evidence of whether people are willing to pay for it. If you find this evidence, continue. If not, move on.
