```python
OPEN = { (start node, g(start node)) }
CLOSED = empty;
while (OPEN != empty):
	X = extract the state with the "lowest value of g(X)" from OPEN
	if (X = goal state):
		return success
	SUCCESSORS = Successor function (X)
	CLOSED.put(X)
	discard any successors contained in OPEN or CLOSED
	OPEN = SUCCESSORS
```
